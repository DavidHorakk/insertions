# insertions

This applications serves as school project for advanced programming.
Application should serve as insertion app, where users can create some insertion of stuff they want to sell, or to buy things from another users.


This app is build on spring framework with hibernate.
While doing this app we used docker container with MySQL database which was connected to this project.
On first start all tables should be created in dbs and some static data should be added (categories and subcategories).

First you will have to register new account to access the page, after that you should be able to login and try some stuff there.
Every user should be able to see all insertions, some detailed informations a should be able to contact owner of insertion if interest via email.

As owner of some insertion you can see them in separate page. On this page you will see only your own insertions and you will be able to edit them or delete them.
As administrator you can see all insertions and you can modify them as you wish with no limits.
